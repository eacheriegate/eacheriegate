## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! 🌏🔭🌱

I am just a human with an insatiable curiosity ~ and a penchant for using satellite imagery and GIS to conduct research at the nexus of water, climate, and ecology.

Many of my projects are in development for upcoming publications. Updates coming soon! Check out my [portfolio](https://eacheriegate.github.io) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eacheriegate/) to see latest.

Languages/tools I work with: R, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Google Earth Engine, ArcGIS (Pro/Online), QGIS, Jupyter, AWS.
